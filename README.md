# Self-Hosting(LINUX ONLY)

**This guide is also mainly written for Ubuntu/Debian(More Distro Support coming soon**
- To start off make sure you have the base requirements: **Python3.7+(PIP Included) and Git**

### Basic Setup

* Clone the repository\
`git clone https://github.com/Yat-o/Kurisu/`
- CD your way into the projects root directory\
`cd path/to/Kurisu`
- Setup your Virtual Environment(Venv)

```shell
python3 -m pip install venv #install venv
python3 -m venv venv #initialize the venv for this project
source venv/bin/activate #activate it
```

* Next it is time to get install setuptools and wheel so packages dont fail to build

  ```shell
  pip3 install setuptools
  pip3 install wheel 
  ```

* After that you are set to now install the bot's requirements\
`pip3 install poetry && poetry install`
- Now rename the configexample.toml and fill it out as needed

```shell
mv configexample.toml config.toml #CASE SENSITIVE
nano config.toml #After filling it out. Save and exit with ctrl+x
```

* Now then if you did everything right you should now be able to run the bot\
Its as simple as `python3 main.py`
- Congrats you have the bot running ðŸ¥³

### Pm2 Setup

Alright so this process if also fairly easy. Just do all the steps in the Basic Setup but dont run the last step
- Make sure you have the one of these: **npm or yarn**
- Install PM2 if you don't already have it\
`npm install pm2 -g` or `yarn global add pm2`
- After installing PM2 you are ready to run the bot\
`pm2 start pm2.json`
- After that you can check on the bot with\
`pm2 logs Kurisu`

### Systemd Setup

Alright this setup is for people who want to run the bot as a Systemd service. Just do everything in the Basic Setup excep the last step.
- First off make sure you have root or sudo access
- Create and edit the service's unit file\
  `sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/kurisu.service`
- Next you will arrive onto an empty file. Copy and paste this into it

```
[Unit]
Description=Kurisu Bot
After=network.target
StartLimitIntervalSec=0

[Service]
Type=simple
Restart=on-success
RestartSec=1
User=root
ExecStartPre=/path/to/Kurisu/venv/bin/python3 -m pip install -U -r requirements.txt
ExecStart=/path/to/Kurisu/venv/bin/python3 -u main.py
WorkingDirectory=/path/to/Kurisu

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

**It is crucial to change the file paths to whichever path you have your clone on!**
- Now save and exit
- After that run\
`sudo systemctl daemon-reload`
  
- Now if all is done. You can now run this to start the service\
`systemctl start kurisu && journalctl -u kurisu.service -f -n 30`
  
- OPTIONAL: If you want the service to start on system restart. You can run this command.\
`systemctl enable kurisu`
