# Linux Selfhosting Guide
## Debian/Ubuntu Distros:
### Prerequisites:
**Please make sure you have all of the following**:
* Python>=3.8
* PIP
* git
### Step 1:
****
Clone the repository:\
`git clone https://github.com/Yat-o/Kurisu`
### Step 2:
****
**Change Your Working Directory**\
`cd path/to/Kurisu`
### Step 3:
****
**Initialize and activate a Virtual Environment**
* `python3 -m pip install virtualenv `
* `python3 -m venv venv`
* `source /venv/bin/activate`
### Step 4:
****
**Install project requirements**\
`pip install -Ur requirements.txt`
### Step 5:
**Rename and fill out config files**
* `mv configexample.toml`
* `nano config.toml` or use micro if you have it 
* Fill out accordingly
* After finishing that `ctrl+o` and `ctrl+x`
* Do the same thing with `configoptions.toml`

`configoptions.toml` does not need to be renamed. It is globally the same for everyone
### Step 6
****
**Run the bot**\
If everything you've done went as planned in this tutorial everything should be ready to go

While in the projects root directory,  run `python main.py`

Hopefully the startup process went smoothly and your bot is online.\
